    <string name="content"><b>Georges Henri Joseph Édouard Lemaître</b>, RAS Associate (French: [ʒɔʁʒᵊ ləmɛ:tʁᵊ] 17 July 1894 – 20 June 1966) was a Belgian Catholic priest, astronomer and professor of physics at the Catholic University of Leuven. \n He proposed on theoretical grounds that the universe is expanding, which was observationally confirmed soon afterwards by Edwin Hubble.He was the first to derive what is now known as Hubble\'s law and made the first estimation of what is now called the Hubble constant, which he published in 1927, two years before Hubble\'s article. Lemaître also proposed what became known as the "Big Bang theory" of the origin of the universe, which he called his \"hypothesis of the primeval atom\" or the \"Cosmic Egg\".\n\n
